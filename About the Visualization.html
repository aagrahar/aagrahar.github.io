    <h1>Housing market trends analysis!</h1>
    <h3>Housing market analysis can be done on many factors. Have picked up couple of factors, to show the market trends using D3 libraries.Each slide has similar bar graphs and tooltip to display data. Upon mouseover any bar it changes its color to Orange and displays the value. When you moveout your mouse, color turns back to blue.
    <br></br>
    Here are few graphs to show you market trends of few popular cities in east bay in 2016. You can view the trend to find which month is highest or lowest selling month, what's median selling price in a city and how the sellers' market is in a city. It also has the link to move around all the slides from any slide.
